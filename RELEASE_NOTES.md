# Release v3.6.0 "Keystone"

> **Release date:** 2026-05-13
> **Type:** Minor — new backwards-compatible tenancy capabilities.

---

## Summary

v3.6.0 "Keystone" introduces first-class single-tenant runtime support while preserving the existing multi-tenant behavior. This release adds explicit tenancy mode configuration, centralizes tenant resolution in a dedicated support helper, and hardens tenant consistency checks across auth and middleware paths.

The codename _Keystone_ reflects the goal of this release: making tenant context the structural anchor for every authenticated request.

---

## Highlights

- **Single-tenant runtime mode** — configure `CARONTE_TENANCY_MODE=single` with `CARONTE_TENANT_ID` to run tenant-pinned applications without custom middleware forks.
- **Shared tenancy helper** — new `CaronteTenancy` support class standardizes tenant-mode and tenant-id resolution across SDK internals.
- **Tenant mismatch enforcement** — auth and request middleware now fail fast with `403` when tenant context is inconsistent.
- **Tenant header propagation** — user/application API calls now forward `X-Tenant-Id` when available to keep server-side checks aligned with resolved tenant context.

---

## Added

- Tenancy configuration support for `multi` and `single` modes.
- New `Ometra\Caronte\Support\CaronteTenancy` helper for tenant resolution and validation.

## Changed

- `AuthController`, `ResolveApplicationContext`, and `ValidateUserToken` now enforce tenant consistency.
- `CaronteHttpClient` now includes tenant context through `X-Tenant-Id` when resolved.
- Documentation updates in deployment/routes guides for tenancy operation details.

## Fixed

- Tenant mismatch flows now return explicit forbidden responses instead of allowing ambiguous context pass-through.

# Release v3.5.0 "Waypoint"

> **Release date:** 2026-05-13
> **Type:** Minor — new backwards-compatible login flow improvements.

---

## Summary

v3.5.0 "Waypoint" improves the tenant-selection sign-in journey for shared users. When Caronte responds with `tenant_selection_required`, the SDK now stores a short-lived pending login context and allows users to complete tenant selection without re-entering their password. The login experiences in both Blade and Inertia were updated to reflect this second-step mode clearly and safely.

The codename _Waypoint_ reflects the new guided checkpoint between credential validation and final tenant-aware authentication.

---

## Highlights

- **Pending login context for tenant selection** — retains email + selection token temporarily to complete the next step cleanly.
- **Improved login UX in both render modes** — email is prefilled/read-only and password is omitted during tenant-selection step.
- **Auth API payload extension** — `tenant_selection_token` now forwarded by `AuthApi::login()` when present.
- **Expanded test coverage** — feature tests validate tenant-selection redirects, token forwarding, and password-less second-step login.

---

## Added

- Pending tenant-selection login context support in the authentication controller flow.

## Changed

- Blade and Inertia login screens now render a tenant-selection-specific form state.
- `AuthApi::login()` signature and payload handling now include optional `tenant_selection_token`.
- Conflict handling paths now preserve tenant-selection data consistently across web and JSON requests.

## Fixed

- Eliminated password re-entry requirement during tenant-selection retry after `409 tenant_selection_required`.

# Release v3.4.0

> **Release date:** 2026-05-11
> **Type:** Minor — new tenant management features added backwards-compatibly.

---

## Summary

v3.4.0 introduces first-class tenant management capabilities in the SDK command surface. This release adds a dedicated `TenantApi` client, two new tenant-focused Artisan commands, and integrates those commands into the interactive admin menu. It also refines the existing users list experience by introducing a clearer `--app-users` option while keeping `--all` as a deprecated compatibility alias.

No breaking changes are introduced.

---

## Highlights

- **New tenant API client** — `TenantApi` now provides tenant listing and detail retrieval helpers.
- **New tenant CLI commands** — `caronte:tenants:list` and `caronte:tenants:show` for operational workflows.
- **Admin menu integration** — tenant commands are available via `caronte:admin` interactive flow.
- **Improved users list semantics** — explicit `--app-users` flag with `--all` preserved as deprecated alias.

---

## Added

### Tenant API

New API client methods:

- `TenantApi::listTenants()`
- `TenantApi::showTenant()`

### Tenant CLI

New Artisan commands:

- `caronte:tenants:list`
- `caronte:tenants:show`

These commands are also exposed from the interactive `caronte:admin` menu.

---

## Changed

- `caronte:users:list` now supports `--app-users` as the canonical option.
- `--all` remains available as a deprecated alias for backwards compatibility.
- Users list output now includes tenant information.
- List command forwarding to the API now uses the correct `app_users` parameter.
- Command behavior tests were expanded to cover tenant command behavior and app-users option handling.

# Release v3.3.1

> **Release date:** 2026-05-11
> **Type:** Patch — backwards-compatible migration compatibility fix.

---

## Summary

v3.3.1 delivers a targeted migration compatibility fix for host applications running newer Laravel versions. The `users_metadata_table` migration no longer depends on Doctrine DBAL-specific schema-manager APIs to inspect primary key metadata. Instead, it uses Laravel schema-builder index introspection when available and falls back to native MySQL/MariaDB index queries when needed.

This patch prevents migration/runtime issues in environments where deprecated Doctrine schema-manager methods are unavailable, while preserving the expected composite primary key behavior for `UsersMetadata`.

---

## Highlights

- **Laravel 10/11/12-safe migration introspection** — no hard dependency on removed Doctrine schema-manager APIs.
- **Driver-aware fallback path** — uses `SHOW INDEX` for MySQL/MariaDB when schema-builder index APIs are not present.
- **Primary key normalization retained** — still enforces `['uri_user', 'scope', 'key']` as the composite primary key.

---

## Fixed

### Users metadata migration compatibility

`database/migrations/user_metadata_table.php` now retrieves current primary-key columns through a compatibility-aware strategy:

1. Uses `Schema::getConnection()->getSchemaBuilder()->getIndexes()` when available.
2. Falls back to `SHOW INDEX ... WHERE Key_name = 'PRIMARY'` for MySQL/MariaDB.
3. Avoids DBAL-only schema-manager dependencies that can fail on newer Laravel versions.

No host application code changes are required.

# Release v3.3.0 "Chronos"

> **Release date:** 2026-05-07
> **Type:** Minor — new features added backwards-compatibly. No breaking changes.

---

## Summary

v3.3.0 "Chronos" delivers three focused improvements to the Caronte SDK: **configurable token clock skew**, a **GitHub Actions CI pipeline**, and a **frontend TypeScript migration** with new legacy-compatible management routes. Clock-skew tolerance closes an operational gap for multi-host deployments where clocks are not perfectly synchronised. The CI pipeline brings automated PHP and TypeScript quality checks to every push and PR. Migrating the React UI to TypeScript improves long-term maintainability and enables compile-time safety for SDK data shapes.

The codename _Chronos_ — the Greek personification of time — reflects the clock-skew theme and the automated, time-orchestrated CI jobs that now guard each commit.

---

## Highlights

- **Configurable clock skew** — `CARONTE_TOKEN_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS` (default `60`) lets deployments tolerate small clock differences without token validation failures.
- **GitHub Actions CI** — PHP (PHPUnit) and TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`) jobs run automatically on push and pull requests.
- **TypeScript frontend** — all React management pages are now `.tsx` with a shared `types.ts` file; no host-application changes required.
- **Legacy management routes** — `users.list` and `users.roles.list` JSON endpoints added for backwards-compatible integrations.
- **Improved Blade views** — create-user modal includes a temporary password field; roles partial is now resilient to missing variables.

---

## Added

### Configurable Token Clock Skew

Set `CARONTE_TOKEN_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS` in your environment (or override `token_clock_skew_seconds` in `config/caronte.php`) to allow a leeway window during `iat`/`nbf` claim validation:

```dotenv
# .env
CARONTE_TOKEN_CLOCK_SKEW_SECONDS=120   # allow up to 2 minutes of clock drift
```

The default is `60` seconds — the same leeway applied silently in previous releases via a hard-coded constant. No host-application changes are required if the default is acceptable.

### GitHub Actions CI Workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs two parallel jobs on every push to `main`/`dev` and on pull requests:

| Job        | Tool           | What it checks                      |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| PHP        | PHPUnit        | Full test suite via `composer test` |
| TypeScript | `tsc --noEmit` | Type correctness of frontend assets |

### Frontend TypeScript Migration

All management React pages have been migrated from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. A new `resources/js/types.ts` file provides strongly-typed interfaces for SDK data structures:

```ts
// resources/js/types.ts (excerpt)
export interface CaronteUser {
    uuid: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    roles: CaronteRole[];
    // ...
}
```

`tsconfig.json` and `package.json` (TypeScript dev-dependencies) are included so the type-check step works with `npm ci && npm run typecheck` out of the box.

### Legacy Management Routes

New named routes for backwards-compatible JSON access:

| Route name         | Method | URI                                      |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `users.list`       | GET    | `/caronte/management/users`              |
| `users.roles.list` | GET    | `/caronte/management/users/{user}/roles` |

`UserController` exposes `list()`, `listRoles()`, and legacy `update()`/`delete()` wrapper methods. `RoleController` redirects unsupported legacy mutations with a clear error response.

---

## Changed

- `ManagementController` now passes configured roles to index/dashboard views.
- Blade `create.blade.php` modal includes a temporary password field.
- `roles-checkboxes.blade.php` partial uses an `availableRoles` fallback to prevent undefined-variable errors.
- `doc/routes-documentation.md` updated to document current vs legacy routes.
- `doc/deployment-instructions.md` notes the new TSX asset compilation step.

# Release v3.2.1

> **Release date:** 2026-05-07
> **Type:** Patch — backwards-compatible security improvement.

---

## Summary

v3.2.1 delivers a targeted security hardening to the Caronte SDK's HTTP layer. Every user-authenticated API call made through `CaronteHttpClient::userRequest()` now includes both the `X-Application-Token` and the `X-User-Token` headers. Previously only `X-User-Token` was sent, which meant the Caronte server could not simultaneously verify the calling application's identity during user-context operations. This patch closes that gap without requiring any host-application changes.

---

## Highlights

- **Dual-token user requests** — `CaronteHttpClient::userRequest()` now sends `X-Application-Token` alongside `X-User-Token`, strengthening the trust chain for all user-context API calls.
- **Test coverage updated** — `AuthContractTest` updated to assert both tokens are present in user requests.

---

## Changed

### `X-Application-Token` Added to User Requests

`CaronteHttpClient::userRequest()` previously sent only the `X-User-Token` header. Starting with v3.2.1 it also sends the `X-Application-Token`, derived from the configured application credentials.

**Before (≤ v3.2.0):**

```php
// Only user token was forwarded
'X-User-Token' => Caronte::getToken()->toString()
```

**After (v3.2.1):**

```php
// Both application and user tokens are forwarded
'X-Application-Token' => $this->makeApplicationToken(),
'X-User-Token'        => Caronte::getToken()->toString(),
```

No configuration changes or host-application code changes are required. The `CARONTE_APP_CN` and `CARONTE_APP_SECRET` credentials already in use for app-level requests are reused here.

# Release v3.2.0 "Hermes"

> **Release date:** 2026-05-06
> **Type:** Minor — new features added backwards-compatibly.
> One internal class removal requires attention if referenced directly. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

---

## Summary

v3.2.0 "Hermes" delivers three focused improvements to the Caronte SDK: **multi-tenant login support**, **phase-2 (flat) JWT claim parsing**, and a **new provisioning API client**. Host applications with multi-tenant user bases can now present a tenant picker at login time without any custom controller logic. The phase-2 JWT changes introduce a flatter claim structure that coexists transparently with the legacy `user` nested claim — no migration required for existing tokens. Server-side tenant provisioning is now first-class through the new `ProvisioningApi`.

The codename _Hermes_ — the messenger god who moved freely between realms and delivered messages between mortals and gods — captures the theme of this release: bridging multiple tenant realms at login, carrying phase-2 claims between client and server, and provisioning new tenants through a dedicated message channel.

---

## Highlights

- **Multi-tenant login** — automatic tenant picker when a user belongs to multiple tenants; 409 `tenant_selection_required` handled gracefully out of the box.
- **Phase-2 JWT claims** — `CaronteUserToken::userPayload()` reads flat top-level claims (`sub`, `tenant_id`, `roles`, `metadata`) while falling back to legacy nested `user` claim.
- **`ProvisioningApi`** — `provisionTenant()` triggers server-side tenant provisioning; `AuthApi` updated for new two-factor and logout endpoints.
- **`.editorconfig` / `.gitattributes`** — repository-wide tooling rules for consistent formatting and line endings.
- **`RouteMode` removed** — `Ometra\Caronte\Support\RouteMode` replaced by inline `Request` detection. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

---

## Added

### Multi-Tenant Login Flow

When the Caronte server returns HTTP 409 `tenant_selection_required`, the SDK now handles it automatically:

| Component                           | Responsibility                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AuthController`                    | Reads `tenant_options` from session; exposes them to view/SPA |
| `AuthApi::login()`                  | Accepts optional `$tenantId`; includes it in sign-in payload  |
| `CaronteResponse::conflict()`       | Returns 409 responses (JSON or redirect) with tenant data     |
| `CaronteResponse::redirectErrors()` | Shapes session error data before redirect                     |
| React login form                    | Renders tenant dropdown when `tenant_options` present         |
| Blade login view                    | Renders tenant dropdown when `tenant_options` present         |

### Phase-2 JWT Claims

`CaronteUserToken::userPayload()` now prefers the phase-2 flat claim structure:

```json
{
    "sub": "user-uuid",
    "tenant_id": "tenant-uuid",
    "roles": ["admin"],
    "metadata": {}
}
```

Falls back to the legacy nested structure if `sub` is absent:

```json
{
    "user": {
        "id": "user-uuid",
        "tenant_id": "tenant-uuid",
        "roles": ["admin"]
    }
}
```

No code changes required in host applications for either structure.

### Provisioning API

```php
// New ProvisioningApi client
$api = new ProvisioningApi();
$api->provisionTenant($tenantId);
```

---

## Changed

- `CaronteUserHelper` metadata lookup now uses the `DB` facade directly.
- `AuthApi` updated for new two-factor endpoints and includes the user token on logout calls.
- Request-based JSON/web detection inlined; `RouteMode` static helper removed.
- Route prefix and login URL config defaults updated.
- Documentation updated: `api-documentation.md`, `business-logic-and-core-processes.md`, `deployment-instructions.md`, `routes-documentation.md`, `tests-documentation.md`.

---

## Removed

- `Ometra\Caronte\Support\RouteMode` — see [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](BREAKING_CHANGES.md) for migration.

# Release v3.1.0 "Aegis"

> **Release date:** 2026-05-04
> **Type:** Minor — new features added backwards-compatibly.
> One dependency change requires attention. See [BREAKING_CHANGES.md](BREAKING_CHANGES.md).

---

## Summary

v3.1.0 "Aegis" extends the Caronte SDK with two major capability pillars: **OpenID Connect (OIDC) federated authentication** and **application-group permission controls**. Host applications can now authenticate users through a standard OIDC/OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE, validate ID tokens against a live JWKS endpoint, and enforce fine-grained server-to-server permissions via group-level application tokens — all without changing a single existing integration point.

The codename _Aegis_ (the divine shield borne by Zeus and Athena) reflects the expanded protective surface this release adds: standards-based identity federation, group-scoped credential boundaries, and declarative permission synchronisation, layered on top of the solid foundation laid by v3.0.0 "Archon".

---

## Highlights

- **OIDC / OAuth 2.0 login** — full authorization code + PKCE flow, JWKS-backed token validation, `dual` mode for gradual migration from legacy JWT.
- **Application-group tokens** — `CARONTE_APPLICATION_GROUP_ID` / `CARONTE_APPLICATION_GROUP_SECRET` credentials enable group-scoped inter-service authentication and permission assertions.
- **Permission sync command** — `caronte:permissions:sync [--dry-run]` declaratively synchronises your configured permissions to the Caronte server.
- **Two new middleware** — `caronte.app-token` and `caronte.app-permissions` for validating application-access tokens and asserting permissions on routes.
- **BeeHive 3.0 required** — `equidna/bee-hive` constraint raised to `^3.0`.

---

## Added

### OpenID Connect Support

A complete `Oidc/` module ships with this release:

| Class                | Responsibility                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `OidcClient`         | Builds authorization URLs, exchanges codes, refreshes tokens |
| `OidcTokenValidator` | Validates OIDC ID tokens against JWKS                        |
| `JwksCache`          | Fetches and caches the JWKS document (configurable TTL)      |
| `Jwk`                | Parses JWK entries; verifies RS256 signatures                |
| `Pkce`               | Generates PKCE `code_verifier` / S256 `code_challenge` pairs |
| `Base64Url`          | URL-safe Base64 encoding helper                              |

**`OidcAuthController`** handles the full flow:

- `GET /caronte/oidc/authorize` — redirects to the OIDC provider.
- `GET /caronte/oidc/callback` — exchanges the authorization code and stores the token.
- `POST /caronte/oidc/logout` — terminates the OIDC session.

**Auth modes** (configured via `CARONTE_AUTH_MODE`):

- `legacy` (default) — existing JWT flow, no OIDC.
- `oidc` — OIDC exclusively; legacy tokens rejected.
- `dual` — accepts both; validator selected from token `kid` header.

**`Caronte::getUser()`** now falls back to OIDC standard claims (`sub`, `name`, `email`, `email_verified`) when the legacy `user` claim is absent.

### Application-Group Tokens & Permission Controls

- **`CaronteApplicationAccessToken`** — generates and validates tokens signed with the group credentials.
- **`CaronteApplicationAccessContext`** — context object bound in the DI container after successful group-token validation; carries resolved permissions.
- **`ValidateApplicationAccessToken`** (`caronte.app-token`) — validates `X-Application-Access-Token` header.
- **`ValidateApplicationAccessPermissions`** (`caronte.app-permissions`) — asserts required permissions on the bound context.

### Permission Synchronisation

- **`PermissionApi`** — API client for the Caronte `/permissions` endpoints.
- **`ConfiguredPermissions`** — encapsulates `config('caronte.permissions')` logic; always injects `root`.
- **`caronte:permissions:sync [--dry-run]`** — Artisan command; `--dry-run` previews diffs without applying.

### New Configuration Keys

```php
// config/caronte.php
'application_group_id'     => env('CARONTE_APPLICATION_GROUP_ID', ''),
'application_group_secret' => env('CARONTE_APPLICATION_GROUP_SECRET', ''),
'auth_mode'                => env('CARONTE_AUTH_MODE', 'legacy'), // legacy | oidc | dual
'oidc' => [
    'issuer'         => env('CARONTE_OIDC_ISSUER', ...),
    'client_id'      => env('CARONTE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID', ...),
    'client_secret'  => env('CARONTE_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET', ''),
    'redirect_uri'   => env('CARONTE_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI', ''),
    'scopes'         => env('CARONTE_OIDC_SCOPES', 'openid profile email'),
    'jwks_cache_ttl' => (int) env('CARONTE_OIDC_JWKS_CACHE_TTL', 3600),
],
```

---

## Changed

- `equidna/bee-hive` constraint: `>=2.0` → `^3.0`.
- `Caronte::syncUser()` now binds a `TenantContext` during local DB operations.
- `CaronteApplicationToken` updated to match and emit group context.
- `CaronteUserToken` updated to support group-signed tokens and multi-mode validation.
- `ResolveApplicationContext` updated to populate group context when present.
- Documentation suite fully updated: `api-documentation.md`, `artisan-commands.md`, `business-logic-and-core-processes.md`, `routes-documentation.md`, `tests-documentation.md`.
- `README.md` extended with Token Types reference and OIDC quick-start.

---

## Dependency Note: BeeHive 3.0

The `equidna/bee-hive` package is now required at `^3.0`. This is the only change that may require action:

```bash
composer require equidna/bee-hive:^3.0
```
